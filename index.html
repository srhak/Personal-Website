                    My name is Sry Hak, and I am currently a third year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I am interested in software design and web development. I always knew that I liked coding ever since high school, but it was really the classes that I took in university that made me fall in love with the entire process of software development and everything that goes into creating a product that users interact with. 
                    <br><br>
                    My interest in web development and frontend engineering took root long ago – I remember spending hours upon hours perfecting infographics, presentations, and projects ever since grade school – but it really flourished with my internship this past summer. Because I interned at a start up, I had the wonderful opportunity of working in a small, close-knit group. Having this privilege, I was able to get experience with each part of the team. What stuck out to me the most throughout this experience was frontend engineering. I followed our frontend engineer and UX design specialist, and I found a lot of satisfaction in seeing how their efforts were directly seen and used by the user.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to this, I am also interested in automation, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. My interest in artificial intelligence began in my first year of university when I joined the Discover AI/AI Summer Immersion program. This program introduced me to artificial intelligence, and ever since I have been wanting to learn more about this field. I was introduced to cybersecurity through Texas A&M’s Cybersecurity club. Being part of this club has introduced me to the field, and I find everything I learned and all of their competitions and events (such as CTF – Capture the Flag) fun and interesting, so this is a field that I am currently learning more about and planning to continue to expand on.
