                    Because I like cooking, I plan to make an application that will generate and reccommend recipes to the user depending on their inputs. Inputs will consist of options such as diet type (such as vegan, keto, etc...), diet restrictions/allergies, and type of food.

                    This app will pull data from the Spoonacular API
